## Latchel Code Challenge

As a small development team, Latchel developers will be expected to wear many hats in the application development process. Front-end or back-end developer one day, database engineer or UI designer another, the ability to be proficient in the entire technology stack, as well as each step in the development life-cycle of the product is important. We beleive this allows the team to be more efficient as each developer is knowledgeable of the entire product, and also allows each developer to feel a greater sense of ownership in the final product. The purpose of this code challenge is to give you the chance to demonstrate your ability to take a feature from concept to completion, given a brief scenario and product requirements. The scenario below was made purposely broad to give you the freedom to make some decisions as to how your application is developed and designed, as well as to show off a bit :)

### Key Notes:

- This task should take between 5 - 10 hours.
- Feel free to ask questions by emailing Ethan at ethan@latchel.com
- Pull requests should be submitted no later than 9PM (PST) on Sunday, January 29th.

### What We're Looking For

- An understanding of Git functions (Pull, Push, Merge, Resolve, Pull Requests)
- Quality Git commit history
- Proficiency with back-end frameworks (Laravel, Symfony, Zend, Yii, Django, .NET, etc.)
- Proficiency with front-end JavaScript frameworks (AngularJS (1 or 2), React, Ember, etc.)
- Proficiency with SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)
- Ability to understand, plan for, and execute upon user stories and product/feature requirements.

- A good-looking UI is a bonus, but not a requirement ;)

## Setup

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a *source* folder to contain your code. 
3. In the *source* directory, please create a web application using the server-side framework of your choice (Latchel currently uses Laravel 5.3) and/or front-end JavaScript framework of your choice (Latchel currently uses Angular 1.5x)

## Scenario & Requirements

Imagine you have been working at Latchel for over 1 year. A new product manager joins the team and is tasked with helping the company build internal productivity tools. You're working with him on his first project, for which you are given the following user story:

"As the engineering manager, I want to be able to visit a web page to view who has contributed the most to our application's repository in the past month, so that I may better plan the upcoming sprint."

Given this user story, build a small application that fulfills the requirements given by the product manager. Since the Latchel repositories are private, use the [NodeJS Repository](https://github.com/nodejs/node) as the repository mentioned in the scenario.
  
### Once Complete
1. Create a SETUP.md in the base directory with setup instructions.
2. Submit a pull request! We will review your application, then discuss with you during the technical interview.

# Good luck, and have fun!
