In response to the user story:

"As the engineering manager, I want to be able to visit a web page to view who has contributed the most to our application's repository in the past month, so that I may better plan the upcoming sprint."

## Instructions to run

- This assumes you have Node installed.  If unsure, run `npm -v` and if you see a version number, you are good to go.
- Using the console, navigate to the /source/frontend folder using `cd source/frontend`
- Run `npm install && npm start`
- Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:3000` with the report loaded
