        <ul>
            <li>Remain static, as in no web server _processing_ required. The only need for a web server is to host the contents of the app folder.</li>
            <li>Integrate best-of-breed JavaScript MVC, styling, ui, and tooling components "the Angular way"</li>
            <li>Provide examples of services, directives, controllers, and filters in a way that can be cherry picked for use elsewhere.</li>
            <li>Styling via Bootstrap with ready-to-build LESS scripts</li>
            <li>Provide example of ui widgets done the Angular way. See the Playground menu option in the top navbar. UI/widget examples include a paginated grid with sort and filter support, accordion, tree, tabs, and date/time pickers.</li>
