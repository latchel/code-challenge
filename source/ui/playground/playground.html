Workaround for one route, many views

From http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13681116/angularjs-dynamic-routing ...

In the $routeProvider URI patters, you can specify variable parameters, like so: $routeProvider.when('/page/:pageNumber' ... , and access it in your controller via $routeParams.

There is a good example at the end of the $route page: http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$route

EDIT (for the edited question):

The routing system is unfortunately very limited - there is a lot of discussion on this topic, and some solutions have been proposed, namely via creating multiple named views, etc.. But right now, the ngView directive serves only ONE view per route, on a one-to-one basis. You can go about this in multiple ways - the simpler one would be to use the view's template as a loader, with a <ng-include src="myTemplateUrl"></ng-include> tag in it ($scope.myTemplateUrl would be created in the controller).

I use a more complex (but cleaner, for larger and more complicated problems) solution, basically skipping the $route service altogether, that is detailed here:

<div class="container" fade-in>
    <h1>Widgets -> {{widgetName}}</h1>
    <hr style="margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <div class="ng-include: widgetUrl"></div>
</div>
